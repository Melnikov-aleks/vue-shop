# [Vue Shop](https://vue-store-ad75d.web.app/ "Vue Shop")

This is the first application, where I've practiced with Vuex, Vue router. It's a simple store with a few pages: catalog page, product page, cart and checkout pages. On this site you can: register or login, see product info, add product to cart, increase/decrease amount of products in cart, delete product from the cart. If you're logged in, you can place an order.

For this project I used a Firebase database and authentication. The interaction with the Firebase REST API is done using the axios library. Authorization tokens are stored in LocalStorage. To validation parameters of login and registration I use Vuelidate.
